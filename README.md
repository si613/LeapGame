# Problem statement

Create the famous 'Frog leap' puzzle game. Try completing the game before starting to get an idea about it's working.
[Demonstration](https://www.neok12.com/games/leap-froggies/leap-froggies.htm).


### Rules 
1. The left set of frogs can only move right; the right set of frogs can only move left.
2. Frogs can move forward one space or move two spaces by jumping over another frog from the opposite side.
3. The puzzle is solved when the two sets of frogs have switched positions.


### Google Drive Link
Google Drive folder for the files in the repositories is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TD-OZqBTnFQ5qa1Xl_tE8teHJTGxkhJF?usp=sharing).

## Results 
1. A Python leap game was created in Jupyter Notebook using fundamental concepts of the language in an interactive and stimulating manner.
2. The concepts utilized to construct the game are:

        a. Data Structure - List
        b. Control Flow - If-Else-Elif statements
        c. Loops - While Loop
3. To increase the game's visual appeal for the players, emojis replaced the text in the initial code. Instead of Green and Brown (frogs), Frog and Rabbit emojis were used. 
4. The `clear_output` function was imported to avoid the repeated prints of the loop iterations and present the output in a clean fashion.

## Challenges
The instructions in the problem statement were easy to follow after a solid base of introductory Python. Issues were observed after uploading the 01 and 02 files in the GitHub repository, which remains unfixed. The files cannot be viewed in the preview and thus can be accessed only through downloads or the Google Drive link provided above. The same issue did not pop up in the 03 file, as the file can be previewed in GitHub without error. 

## Improvements to be Made
The leap game can be improved by adding code that recognises when players are stuck with no valid moves left and prints a message informing the same. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the project successfully addressed the challenge of creating the 'Frog Leap' game using fundamental Python concepts in a Jupyter notebook. The game adheres to specified rules, incorporating concepts of lists, control flow, and loops. Emojis enhance the game's visual appeal, replacing traditional text representation in the problem statement. Despite these achievements, challenges arose during the GitHub repository upload, particularly with files 01 and 02, preventing preview and necessitating access through downloads or the provided Google Drive link. The resolution of this issue remains pending. Overall, the project demonstrates a practical application of Python programming skills while showcasing creativity in game design.
